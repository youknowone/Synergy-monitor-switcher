# Synergy-monitor-switcher for AppleSilicon

based on [@magdesign's switcher](https://github.com/magdesign/Synergy-monitor-switcher).

I replaced ddccontrol with [m1ddc](https://github.com/waydabber/m1ddc).
See [ddcctl](https://github.com/kfix/ddcctl) for Intel mac.

Remember you should change 15 and 16 for your actual input sources.
